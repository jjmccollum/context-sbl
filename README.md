## To Do

- [ ] Introduce methods for parsing multiple publishers and multiple journal volumes and pages
- [ ] Introduce helper methods for identifying (for the purpose of conditional formatting) and rendering dates of various forms that can be provided in the `date` field (e.g., YYYY and YYYY--YYYY can be printed as-is, but YYYY-MM should be parsed as Month YYYY, and YYYY-MM-DD should be parsed as DD Month YYYY)
- [ ] Add an authorconversion that prints the first of multiple authors in inverted order, but the rest in normal order
- [ ] Modify the `short` cite alternative to produce shorthand or author-title citations, per the SBL guidelines reproduced at https://github.com/dcpurton/biblatex-sbl/blob/master/test/biblatex-sbl-examples.ref.txt (it would probably be best to implement individual setups for this for each category)
- [ ] Add a final pass over the entry to move commas and periods that are after right quotes to positions before them, in accordance with American style? (If we could also handle alternating parenthesis to bracket conversions in such a pass, then we wouldn't need a `paren` citation alternative.)
